# Eternia-PSP-battery
Removes battery icon from PSP game Tales of Eternia (EU)

# Usage
1. Install Python3
2. Run this command: `python toe_battery.py "C:/ToE_EU.iso"`
3. Battery should now be removed from the top-right corner

## Notes:
This script should work with both the EU version and Undub version only.  In fact, it's safer to the use the `xdelta` patches in the release.
